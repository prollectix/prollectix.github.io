                    <p>The merging area of highway ramps faces multiple challenges, including traffic congestion, collision risks, speed mismatches, driver behavior uncertainties, limited visibility, and bottleneck effects. However, autonomous vehicles engaging in depth coordination between vehicle and road in merging zones, by pre-planning and uploading travel trajectories, can significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of merging zones.In this paper,we mainly introduce mainline priority cooperation method to achieve the time and space cooperative control of highway merge.Vehicle-mounted intelligent units share real-time vehicle status and driving intentions with Road Section Management Units, which pre-plan the spatiotemporal trajectories of vehicle travel. After receiving these trajectories, Vehicle Intelligent Units strictly adhere to them. Through this deep collaboration between vehicles and roads, conflicts in time and space during vehicle travel are eliminated in advance.</p>

                    <p>Traditional manual driving and single-vehicle-based intelligent driving have limitations in real-time and accurate acquisition of the current driving status and intentions of surrounding vehicles, leading to vehicles typically maintaining appropriate safe distances from each other. Yet, accidents still frequently occur, especially in merging areas; meanwhile, it is difficult to comprehensively obtain the conditions of road infrastructure. These limitations not only restrict the further improvement of road capacity but also result in irreparable losses of life and property. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper constructs a space-time global view of the road traffic system based on a real-time sharing mechanism, enabling both road users and managers to timely access the driving intentions of nearby vehicles and the real-time status of road infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>In the domain of intelligent transportation systems, especially within the context of autonomous vehicle control, the preemptive holistic collaborative system has been presented as a promising solution to bring a remarkable enhancement in traffic efficiency and a substantial reduction in the accident rate, demonstrating a great potential of development. In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</p>

                    <p>In the context of autonomous driving on expressways, the issue of ensuring safe and efficient ramp merging remains a significant challenge. Existing systems often struggle to accurately assess the status and intentions of other vehicles, leading to a persistent occurrence of accidents despite efforts to maintain safe distances. This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal cooperative control approach integrating vehicle-road coordination to address this critical issue. A comprehensive methodology is developed, beginning with the calculation of safe distances under varying spatiotemporal conditions. This involves considering multiple factors, including vehicle speed differentials, positioning errors, and clock synchronization errors. Subsequently, an advanced vehicle conflict risk evaluation model is constructed. By incorporating collision acceleration and emergency acceleration as key parameters, this model offers a more accurate and detailed evaluation of potential risks during the ramp merging process. Based on the calculated safe distances and conflict risk evaluations, a mainline priority coordinated control method is formulated. This method enables the pre-planning of vehicle trajectories, effectively reducing conflicts among vehicles. Through rigorous simulations using diverse traffic volume and speed scenarios, the efficacy of the proposed strategy is validated. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements, with the average delay time reduced by an impressive 97.96% and fuel consumption decreased by 6.01%. These outcomes indicate that the proposed approach not only enhances the speed of vehicle merging but also significantly reduces latency and fuel consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of ramp merging operations.</p>

                        Traditional manual driving and single-vehicle intelligent driving systems face significant challenges in accurately and promptly acquiring the current driving status and intentions of surrounding vehicles. As a result, while vehicles generally maintain safe distances, accidents still frequently occur, particularly in merging areas. Additionally, assessing the conditions of road infrastructure comprehensively remains difficult. These limitations not only impede the enhancement of road capacity but also lead to severe and often irreparable losses of life and property.
                        To address these challenges, this book proposes a Safe and Efficient Road Transportation System(SERTS), which encompasses two groundbreaking technical solutions. The first solution utilizes a real-time information-sharing mechanism to offer a spatiotemporal holistic view of the road traffic system. This system allows road users, onboard computers, and managers to promptly access the driving intentions of nearby vehicles and the real-time status of road infrastructure.
                        Secondly, a spatiotemporal coordinated technical solution is introduced. This approach involves the Road Section Management Unit (RSMU) pre-planning vehicle trajectories, which are then executed by Vehicle Intelligent Units (VIUs) to preemptively eliminate potential conflicts between vehicles. This results in a deeply coordinated vehicle-road scenario. Additionally, a method for calculating the safe distance between vehicles in this context is presented. The urgency of potential vehicle collisions is quantitatively assessed based on collision acceleration.
                        Finally, the book proposes and validates two spatiotemporal coordinated control strategies for expressway ramp merging through simulation experiments: mainline priority and ramp priority. These strategies offer effective solutions to enhance road traffic efficiency while ensuring safety.
